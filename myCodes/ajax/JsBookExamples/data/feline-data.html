        It
        is the most widespread of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. Cougars are muscular and
        have

    <h3>Lion</h3>

    <p id="lion">
        The lion, a large feline native to both Africa and India, is easily recognized by its muscular build, short,
        rounded
        head, and the dark, hairy tuft at the end of its tail. Lions exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males and females
        displaying distinct physical traits. Adult male lions are particularly notable for their manes, the thick,
        flowing
        hair that adorns their necks and heads. As carnivores, lions live in social groups known as prides. Sadly, they
        are
        vulnerable to extinction due to habitat loss and poaching.

    <p>
        Black panthers are large felines that belong to the big cat family. They are known for their black fur, which is
        actually a result of a melanistic color variation. This means that they have an excess of melanin, the pigment
        that
        gives animals their color. The most common species of black panther are the jaguar (Panthera onca) and the
        leopard
        (Panthera pardus). Black panthers are powerful and agile animals with strong bodies, long tails for balance, and
        sharp claws and teeth. They are solitary hunters and are found in various habitats across the world, including
        forests, grasslands, and mountains.
